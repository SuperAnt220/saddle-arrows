# Saddle Arrows
This survival-friendly configurable datapack provides a new crafting recipe for saddle arrows, which requires 1 saddle in the center and 8 regular arrows in all other slots.
By shooting the arrow, the player will automatically mount the arrow and fly with it.

The config has 4 settings, as you can see on the screenshot:
